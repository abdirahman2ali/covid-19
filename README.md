# COVID-19
This is the data repository for COVID-19 cases in the province of Ontario. This repo also takes a look at calculating the reproductive number for covid-19 in the province of Ontario. The reproduction number (R) is often used to reflect how infectious a disease is. We will, in part, use this quantity to assess alternative interventions to control an outbreak, because R is changed by control measures. The basic reproduction number (R0) is the reproduction number when there is no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission. We refer to R as an effective reproduction number when there is some immunity or some intervention measures are in place.
